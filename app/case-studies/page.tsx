        The Pinning Bees started this live case study with my own personal
        Pinterest account in February '23. I am an author of kids educational
        books in the early learning niche.
        <br />
        <br />
        We pushed various marketing messages and promotional content to
        different audiences, including the home schooling sector, parents and
        caregivers. Within a month, we reached the top of search results for the
        main keywords, dominating the top of the Pinterest feed.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>Constant Testing</span>
        <br />
        <span>Static Format:</span> 280 impressions
        <br />
        <span>Pan and Zoom at .8 secs:</span>2100 impressions
        <br />
        <span>Our proprietary tools:</span> 16,000 impressions
        <br />
        <br />
        This testing was by utilizing the same image, what a difference the
        choice of pin format makes! We are excited to use our tools on clients'
        accounts to create a viral effect.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>Audience Targeting</span>
        <br />
        After realizing the hidden goldmine in the large “teachers and
        classrooms” niche for my brand, we decided to pivot by targeting this
        audience. As a result, due to the nature of this niche, my book sales
        received frequent large spikes in book sales. To put this into
        perspective, on a single day, I sold over 480 books. Overall I have
        gained 1 million impressions, and a 50% increase in book sales since we
        started marketing my books on Pinterest just several months ago. Using
        the right type of landing page that aligns with the ad creative that
        initially captures a shoppers attention will help boost its conversion.
        <br />
        <br />
        Increased sales are expected once I start nurturing my ideal target
        audiences through lead generated magnet such as blogs, listicles,
        newsletters and free ebooks. Many Pinterest niches, including my own,
        offer a full funnel sales solution for every step of the shoppers
        journey. There are a wide variety of lead gen options available to
        direct warm traffic to a website with opt-ins to further increase a
        customer base through email marketing.
        <br />
        <br />
        Note that a seasoned, thriving Pinterest account and a strong customer
        email list are very valuable assets when constructing your exit plan to
        sell your brand. And both work perfectly hand in hand, further
        capitalizing on your content Ad spend!
